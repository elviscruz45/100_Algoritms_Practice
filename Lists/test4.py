"""List being an integral part of Python day-to-day programming has to be learned 
by all Python users and having a 
knowledge of its utility and operations is essential and always a plus.
So this article discusses one such utility of finding the no. of elements in a list."""

# Python code to demonstrate
# length of list
# using naive method

# Initializing list
test_list = [ 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 ]

# Printing test_list
print ("The list is : " + str(test_list))

# Finding length of list
# using loop
# Initializing counter
counter = 0
for i in test_list:
	
	# incrementing counter
	counter = counter + 1

# Printing length of list
print ("Length of list using naive method is : " + str(counter))
